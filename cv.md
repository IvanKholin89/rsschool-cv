## About myself

I work as a sales Manager. I have never encountered web development. Since July 2019, I started learning web programming on the recommendation of friends who have reached a good level in web development. While studying basic programming languages in HTML Academy, I became interested in this in a serious way. The goal today is to learn how to use developer tools at an advanced level, as well as learn JS, REACT, etc..
